    "\n",
    "The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image."

    "The Naïve Bayes algorithm is comprised of two words Naïve and Bayes, Which can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Naïve**: It is called Naïve because it assumes that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features. Such as if the fruit is identified on the bases of color, shape, and taste, then red, spherical, and sweet fruit is recognized as an apple. Hence each feature individually contributes to identify that it is an apple without depending on each other.\n",
    "- **Bayes**: It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes Theorem."
